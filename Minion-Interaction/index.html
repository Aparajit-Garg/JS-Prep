        <h2> Fun Fact </h2>
        <p> The Minions language is mostly unintelligible or barely intelligible talking with some words 
            from the Spanish, French, Italian, Filipino, and other foreign languages. Many will also likely 
            notice the presence of various words that refer to food. In the Minions song, there’s the banana 
            and potato. The Minions were also heard saying “poulet tiki masala,” which is the French equivalent 
            for “Indian chicken dish.” </p>
